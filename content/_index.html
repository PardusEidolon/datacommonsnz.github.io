    The amount, variety, and use of data is growing exponentially. Concerns about privacy and using data in service of the common good are growing just as fast.

    <div class="center measure-wide f5 pv5 lh-copy ph2">
        <p>The idea of establishing a Data Commons as a means to put these principles into action was
            first proposed by James Mansell in April 2015, in a report to the New Zealand Productivity Commission called
            Handing Back the
            Social Commons. Since then, the idea of establishing a Data Commons for New Zealand has generated a growing
            amount of interest and offers of support.</p>

        <p>In June 2016 the New Zealand Data Futures Partnership, the NEXT Foundation, the Bioheritage
            Science Challenge, and Infection agreed to co- fund the development of a blueprint for an alternative model
            to enable data sharing in New Zealand.
        </p>

        <p>The project had two deliverables:</p>

        <p>Firstly, the formation of a network of interested volunteers in New Zealand who have a range of technical
            expertise and a deep interest in data integration and reuse. EXP Ltd (part of the Enspiral collective) was
            contracted to convene an open conversation, using online tools such as Loomio and Gitbooks, a series of
            workshops and interviews, and a two-day retreat with this group of volunteers.</p>

        <p>The outcome of those conversations was the second deliverable, the Data Commons Blueprint, where we outline
            the conceptual thinking behind the idea of a “Data Commons” approach. We describe the high-level design
            features that will make it work, and outline the steps required to build one.</p>

        <p>In preparing this document, the working group’s goal was to provide what we believe is a safer, lower-cost
            and higher-value alternative to the current approaches to the challenge of data integration and reuse. While
            there is still much work to be done, we believe this document establishes a model that is worth further
            investigation. The technical experts involved consider it to be relatively low-cost and technically feasible
            to prototype.</p>

        <p>The New Zealand Data Commons Blueprint is published under an open Creative Commons license so that other
            people can extend the conversation. We are not the only group trying to solve the dilemma of how to use
            integrated data for public, economic, scientifc and environmental good while at the same time managing the
            significant risks inherent in doing so.</p>
