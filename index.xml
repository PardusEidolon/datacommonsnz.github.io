We describe the high-level design features that will make it work, and outline the steps required to build one. Understanding Knowledge As a Commons The introductory chapter from Understanding Knowledge as a Commons: From Theory to Practice (2006, MIT Press) edited by C. Hess and E. Ostrom. A very useful short overview of some of the central issues in establishing a Data Commons.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>/contact/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 13:16:27 +1300</pubDate><guid>/contact/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Process</title><link>/process/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 12:55:15 +1300</pubDate><guid>/process/</guid><description>A mutli-stakeholder engagement and co-design process, online and in person, to envision a data future that works for all of us. The Data Commons Collaborative Design project is convening three design teams working in parallel.Each team will consist of subject matter experts working with researchers on an aspect of the solution. At appropriate times during the project, the teams will bring their findings togetherand work on the blueprint of design options.</description></item></channel></rss>
